## AES
Its a crappy implementation of AES/Rijndael. This is just for fun so its very inefficient and probably has many memory leaks and all that good stuff :)

### How to use
* Enter the root directory of the project
* Run ```make``` to build
* The binary will be in the bin/ directory
* To run tests type ```make tests```
* The tests binary will be in the same place (bin/)

Thanks for checking this out.
